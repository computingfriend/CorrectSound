# CorrectSound
CorrectSound: Efficient and User Friendly Proof Verification System for Mere Mortals

# Goals
Develop an easy to use proof verification system. 🏖️

Never compromise on soundness. 🐞

Source code must be easy to read by an average programmer. 🙆‍♀️

Excellent documentation. 📝

Free and open source forever. 🎉

# Architecture
Written in JavaScript. 📃

Proof files are written in JavaScript syntax. 👍

A JavaScript parser is used to parse proof files. 😆

However, JavaScript syntax is used to represent completely different things. 😛

The axioms are simple and consistent. 😎

zk-SNARK proofs are used to quickly verify proofs that have been thoroughly checked for correctness before. 🏃

Always secure. No arbitrary code execution. 🔐
