# 🌠 Axioms
CorrectSound uses first order logic with several axioms to help you model almost anything. 🐷

These axioms are abstract and don't correspond to mathematical concepts. They serve as building blocks for you to prove anything you want. 🍉

Think of them as your favorite programming language's type system. A type system is entirely arbitrary but it helps prevent bugs from happening. 😼
