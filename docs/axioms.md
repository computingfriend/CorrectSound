# 🌠 Axioms

CorrectSound uses first order logic with several axioms to help you model almost anything. 🐷

These axioms are abstract and don't correspond to mathematical concepts. They serve as building blocks for you to prove anything you want. 🍉

Think of them as your favorite programming language's type system. A type system is entirely arbitrary but it helps prevent bugs from happening. 😼

Similarly, CorrectSound axioms are designed to prevent you from making mistakes when proving things. 🦺

The collection of axioms that CorrectSound uses is called ZFC. 🦸

ZFC is a battle tested collection of axioms that is consistent, well documented and easy to use. 🥁
