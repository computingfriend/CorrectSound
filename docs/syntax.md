# 🎃 Syntax
CorrectSound proofs are written in JavaScript syntax. 💕

CorrectSound doesn't have its own parser. It reuses the [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) parser. 🍄

CorrectSound then traverses the syntax tree and interpret it according to CorrectSound's own rules. ⛵

CorrectSound doesn't believe in reinventing the wheel. CorrectSound wants to deliver a working product quickly and provide a great user experience. 🦄
