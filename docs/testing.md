# 🪨 Testing

Testing is needed to ensure software correctness. 🧘

CorrectSound uses Ava and Stryker. 🌈

Ava is a test runner. It can run tests in parallel. 🚎

Stryker is a mutation testing tool. It modifies source code in a sandbox to see whether tests fail or not. 😻

Modifications are called mutants. 🤠

Mutants that pass the tests are called "survived". 🛀

Mutants that fail the tests are called "killed". 💀

We don't need to care about killed mutants. 👻

Survived mutants require closer inspection. 🕵️

Survived mutants may or may not indicate a flaw in the tests. 🥲

We test the code by generating random inputs. Then we run the code and check the output. 👨‍💻
